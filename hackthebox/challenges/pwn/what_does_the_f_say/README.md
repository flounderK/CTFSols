what_does_the_f_say

Here is my solution to the what_does_the_f_say challenge on HTB.
What_does_the_f_say.zip is the original challenge zip, and can be opened with 'hackthebox'
what_does_the_f_say.7z is my solution script for the challenge. It is encrypted with the flag for the challenge.

Once the challenge is retired I will remove the encryption
